# Freshly Fetched

Freshly Fetched was a Mod 3 group project in the Front End program at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). The assignment was to build out a multi-page application using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and an additional technology of our choosing that we would not be receiving instruction on. We chose [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)! All of our user acceptance criteria was tested using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html).

Our project is deployed on []().
