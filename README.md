# Freshly Fetched

Freshly Fetched was a Mod 3 group project in the Front End program at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). The assignment was to build out a multi-page application using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and an additional technology of our choosing that we would not be receiving instruction on. We chose [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)! All of our user acceptance criteria was tested using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html).

Our project is deployed [here](https://freshly-fetched.netlify.app/).

## Contributors

This application was built by [Ash O'Brien](https://github.com/AshleyOh-bit), [Beth Meeker](https://github.com/Meekb), [Claire Fields](https://github.com/clairefields15), and [Alex Kio](https://github.com/alexmkio/); Front End Engineering, Mod 3 students at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).

## Technologies Used

This application was built using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) javascript framework with the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) superset. [Router](https://reactrouter.com/) was used for multi-page functionality. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) was used for testing. GitHub and Git were used for version control and collaboration. HTTP Request is being used to Get inside of an async await function.

## The Evolution of the Project

We started this project by creating a living ["DTR document"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9hS2gDg9vJs3ZqQWIU51EeSJ721vItyTz-j72Za_mU/edit#heading=h.6r7y3guy9gso) in which we discussed each other's learning goals, preferred working style, personal schedules, communication preferences, etc. We moved on to digest the [project spec and rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html), and started exploring APIs brainstorming about the potential problems we could solve with each. We settled on [this wretched Farmers' Market API](https://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html) provided by the USDA. We then conducted research on similar applications and established our [wireframes](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l5OWQ6g=/). We created this GitHub repo and initialized it with a [PR template](https://github.com/Meekb/freshest-app/blob/main/pull_request_template.md) and a [project board](https://github.com/Meekb/freshest-app/projects/1). We used [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18v-D7t7S92gWoUL19NvGLPDcDYorl9NXbdTqHXONo4Q/edit#heading=h.gsvlk44bqe01) to outline our initial thoughts and project iterations and turned all of our user acceptance criteria into project issues. We spent the next two days independently studying [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) before reconvening to discuss our findings and begin issue assignment. We checked-in as a group daily as we chipped away at this project.
